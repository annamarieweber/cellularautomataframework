This is directory where all tests for the different C++ and C implementations go.
This directory and the example directory, contain source C++ program with a main
(can be executed)

Current test that can be build with source files in this subdirectory are:

- test_CA_compute.cxx makes calls to a different functions implemented in the input service cellular automata object file.


- test_insertionsort : tests the timing information and effiency of each type of arrays in ascending, descending, same values, and randomly filled array

- test_mergesort3 : tests the timing information and effiency of each type of arrays in ascending, descending, same values, and randomly filled array
                    
- test_mergesort2 : tests the timing information and effiency of each type of arrays in ascending, descending, same values, and randomly filled array

- test_selectionsort : tests the timing information and effiency of each type of arrays in ascending, descending, same values, and randomly filled array

- test_quicksort : tests the timing information and effiency of each type of arrays in ascending, descending, same values, and randomly filled array


  Files:
	- README: this file with a general description of the test subdirectory

  - Makefile: contains commands that build the targets listed above
