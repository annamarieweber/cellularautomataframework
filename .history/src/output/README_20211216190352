This is directory where all the output functions in implementations of C++ are compiled.
Tests of these  functions and procedures are in the ../tests subdirectory. These output functions is also used inside programs in other src directory files.

PATH ROOT_DIR/src/mergesort2/.
  Files:
	- README: this file with a general description of the math library and objects subdirectory

	- Makefile: a makefile that can generate all objects and libraries associated with insertion sort function
	            (e.g. insertion sort). The make file can also clean all math objects in the ../../lib directory
		    shell> make cleanall
		    or create all the utilities objects
		    shell> make all
		
		 - mergesort2.cxx: implements merge sort algorithm recursively splitting the array into 2 parts, where it is sorted and merged. 3-way merge sort splits the array into into 3 parts. It recursively breaks down the arrays to subarrays of size one half. It divides the input array into two halves, and sorts  two halves subarrays, and then merges the two sorted halves.
