This is directory where all source C++ and C Files are being compiled.  
Tests of these functionalities are in the ../tests subdirectory and examples are
in the ../examples subdirectory.  

The subdirectories here are:
heapsort/ For binary heap data structure 
insertionsort/ For insertion sort sorting algorithm
mergesort3/ For 3-way mergesort 
mergesort2/ For 2-way mergesort 
quicksort/ For divide and conquer algorithm quicksort
selectionsort/ For selection sort sorting algorithm

  Files:
	- README: this file with a general description of the utils subdirectory

	No makefile at this level to force builds per use/functionality (e.g., selection sort, insertion sort, heap sort, 3-way merge, 2-way merge and quick sort etc)
