# This directory contains only executable codes. The Makefile in this directory
# can execute command lines statements to run the different programs.  This is 
# a form of documentation.

# C++ Programs in the ../tests/ subdirectory create executables that are moved
# to this subdirectory.  The subdirectory ../examples should also put store 
# here all the executable files after compilation.
